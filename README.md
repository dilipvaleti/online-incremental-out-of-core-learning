# online-incremental-out-of-core-learning
online learning also known as incremental or out-of-core learning
The SGDRegressor(Stochastic gradient decent) also provides a partial_fit() method, so that you can incrementally train on small batches of data. In fact, all learning algorithms that are compatible with standard optimisation algorithms like (stochastic) gradient decent, adam, RMSprop, and so on have this capability.
